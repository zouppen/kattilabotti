How to run

$ cp bot.conf.example bot.conf
$ emacs bot.conf   # or vim, nano, ...

Link (or copy) mysql-connector and pircbot to the directory where
KattilaBot is in (adapt the following to your directory structure):

$ ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java-5.1.6-jar mysql-connect-java.jar
$ ln -s ~/sorsat/pircbot/pircbot.jar pircbot.jar

Then you can start KattilaBot.

$ ./start.sh

The bot joins to the defined channel and writes its process ID to
"kattilabot.pid".

Bot doesn't automatically scan the database for changes. It waits for
SIGUSR2 signal. It's your job to create a hook which sends signal
either periodically or when there is new data in the database. It
doesn't break anything if you signal KattilaBot in vain.

You can test the scan by running

$ KILL -USR2 pid_of_kattilabot

My set-up is to run KattilaBot in user www-data and use PHP to send a
signal to KattilaBot.
