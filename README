How to run

$ cp bot.conf.example bot.conf
$ emacs bot.conf   # or vim, nano, ...

Link (or copy) mysql-connector and pircbot to the directory where
KattilaBot is in (adapt the following to your directory structure):

$ ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar mysql-connector-java.jar
$ ln -s ~/sorsat/pircbot/pircbot.jar pircbot.jar

To compile KattilaBot, you need CLASSPATH entry. The following should work in Bash: 

$ export CLASSPATH=.:mysql-connector-java.jar:pircbot.jar
$ javac *.java

Unix signalling requires "Oracle specific" sun.misc.Signal
package. Using it produces warning. You can safely ignore them or send
me a patch to get rid of using proprietary APIs.

Then you can start KattilaBot.

$ ./start.sh

The bot joins to the defined channel and writes its process ID to
"kattilabot.pid".

Bot doesn't automatically scan the database for changes. It waits for
SIGUSR2 signal. It's your job to create a hook which sends signal
either periodically or when there is new data in the database. It
doesn't break anything if you signal KattilaBot in vain.

You can test the scan by running

$ KILL -USR2 pid_of_kattilabot

My set-up is to run KattilaBot in user www-data and use PHP to send a
signal to KattilaBot.

Simulation
==========

You can try simulating with historical data. It's useful in debugging
and development. In those late hours of day there may not be anyone in
the place you are monitoring. So we just move the clock! Put the
following to irc.conf to report happenings 8 hours ago:

history_hours=8

If history_hours is undefined or zero, we are using real-time data.
